### Using Claude for your digital skills development

AI tools like Claude can be powerful learning companions when you're starting to code. Rather than just generating solutions, 
think of them as a patient tutor available 24/7. When you're stuck on a concept, ask for explanations in your own words
 or request analogies that make sense to you. Encountering an error? Paste your code and ask the AI to help you understand
  why it's breakingâ€”not just fix it. Another effective way to engage with Claude is "learning mode": Change the response style
  to learning mode and they will guide you through problems step-by-step with questions rather than answers, 
  helping you discover solutions yourself. This approach builds genuine understanding and problem-solving skills. 
  Remember, the goal isn't to have AI write your code, but to use it as a coach that helps you think like a programmer 
  and develop the skills to solve problems independently.
