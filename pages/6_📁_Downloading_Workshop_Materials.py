### Download the Python workshop materials

The DSL teaches Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

You can download the notebooks from below.

### Python Fundamentals

The Python Fundamentals workshops are for beginners that have no prior experience in programming with Python and cover the following topics:
- Numerical variables
- String variables
- Type casting
- Lists
- For loops
- Conditionals
- Writing functions
- Basics of data cleaning
- Basics of inspecting data (exploratory data analysis)
- Data visualisation
        
The notebooks will be combined into a single zip file. Mac-users can simple double click on the zip file to unpack the jupyter notebooks.
Window-users have to right-click on the zip file, select Extract All... and then click on Extract.
            
This should create a new folder named PythonSeries which contains the different jupyter notebook files.
