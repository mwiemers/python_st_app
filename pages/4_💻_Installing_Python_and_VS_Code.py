## Installing Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook and VS Code on your MacBook
        
With Anaconda you can install Python, Python libraries and easily manage different Python environments on your personal laptop.
            
You will use Anaconda in combination with VS Code to write code in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.
            
The final video will show you how to open the Python exercises as jupyter notebooks in VS Code and how to write and run Python code.

### Downloading Anaconda Installation File

Depending on whether your Mac has an M1/M2 or Intel processor, you will have to download a different version of Anaconda. Check the processor 
type by clicking on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen and selecting About this Mac.

If you have an M1/M2 processor, you will see Apple M1 in the Overview tab. If you have an Intel processor, you will see Intel in the Overview tab.
